    The Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change happened during the Twenty-Three year period in Bengaluru Urban District, Karnataka. One of the fast-growing cities in India is Bengaluru which has undergone many changes to its landscape as it moves to urbanization. Land cover / land use changes (LULC) were assessed through the employment of remote sensing data and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, for years 2000 to 2023. Built-up, vegetation, water bodies and barren land are classified based on the desired land use through a machine learning algorithm known as Support Vector Machine. This page shows the significant expansion in built-up landuse, mainly at the cost of greenspace and bare land. The change underscores an urgent need for sustainable urban planning to tackle environmental risks associated with the expansion of megacities, such as increased temperatures.
